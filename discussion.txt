I can think of 2 ways in which the system could be extended to support more than
10,000 unique items using the same 6 digit displays.

1. The asset ID's could be displayed as hexadecimals which use 0-9 and A-F. This would 
allow up to 16^4=65,536 unique ID's although characters 'B' and 'D' would need to be 
displayed as lowercase letters to avoid confusion with 8 and 0. The checksum numbers 
would be displayed as before but the algorithm would be extended to also use the 5th 
digit as (x * 10000).

2. Up to 100,000 unique asset ID's could be supported by using the last 5 characters
of the display to show the ID and only the first character as the checksum. The way the 
checksum is displayed could be changed so each of the 7 segments of the character 
display represent a binary digit e.g. off=0, on=1. There are 2^7=128 possible 
combinations so the exisiting 100 values for the checksum could still be supported in 
this form. The algorithm for the checksum would be extended as above.

Also these could be combined and use 5 hexadecimal characters which would be able to 
support up to 16^5=1,048,576 unique asset ID's.
